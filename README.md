Tell the Chrome Dino to Jump
<hr/>

This is a re-creation of the classic Chrome Game with Javascript where instead of the Spacebar, you yell "JUMP" for the Chrome Dino to jump. <br/>
<br/>
It uses the Web Speech API (which in Chrome, is powered by the Google Speech Libraries) to trigger jumps. <br/><br/><br/>
